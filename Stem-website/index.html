    <h2>What is STEM?</h2>
    <p>
        STEM stands for <b>Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics</b>.
        STEM education helps students learn concepts by doing activities, experiments,
        and real-life problem solving instead of only reading from textbooks.
    </p>

    <h2>What is STEM Racing India?</h2>
    <p>
        STEM Racing India is an educational program that teaches students
        scientific concepts through exciting learning activities.
        It helps students understand how science is applied in the real world
        using simple experiments and observations.
    </p>


    <h2>Science Concepts Explained</h2>

    <h3>1. Force</h3>
    <p>
        Force is a push or a pull that can change the shape, direction,
        or speed of an object. Without force, objects cannot move.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Examples:</b> pushing a door, kicking a football, pulling a drawer.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Motion</h3>
    <p>
        Motion means the movement of an object from one place to another.
        An object is said to be in motion when its position changes with time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Examples:</b> moving bus, flying bird, rolling ball.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Speed</h3>
    <p>
        Speed tells us how fast an object is moving.
        It is the distance travelled by an object in a given amount of time.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Formula:</b> Speed = Distance ÷ Time
    </p>

    <h3>4. Time</h3>
    <p>
        Time is the duration taken by an object to complete its motion.
        In science experiments, time is measured using a clock or a stopwatch.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Friction</h3>
    <p>
        Friction is a force that opposes motion when two surfaces rub against each other.
        It slows down moving objects.
    </p>
    <p>
        Friction is useful because it helps us walk without slipping,
        but too much friction can reduce speed.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Air Resistance</h3>
    <p>
        Air resistance is a type of friction caused by air.
        Objects moving through the air experience air resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
        Smooth shapes experience less air resistance and move more easily.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Gravity</h3>
    <p>
        Gravity is the force that pulls objects towards the Earth.
        It is why objects fall when dropped.
    </p>

<h3>8. Aerodynamics</h3>

<p>
    Aerodynamics is the study of how air flows around an object when it moves.
    Whenever an object moves through air, the air applies a force on it.
    This force is known as air resistance or drag.
</p>

<p>
    Air resistance acts in the opposite direction of motion and tries to slow
    the object down. Faster moving objects experience more air resistance,
    while slower objects experience less air resistance.
</p>

<h3>Effect of Shape on Aerodynamics</h3>
<p>
    The shape of an object plays an important role in aerodynamics.
    Objects with flat or rough surfaces face more air resistance.
    Objects with smooth and curved surfaces allow air to flow easily around them.
</p>

<h3>Streamlined Shape</h3>
<p>
    A streamlined shape is a smooth shape that helps reduce air resistance.
    This shape allows air to move smoothly around the object,
    helping it move faster and more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
    Examples of streamlined shapes include aeroplanes, birds, fish and fast-moving cars.
</p>

<h3>Simple Experiment</h3>
<p>
    If a flat sheet of paper and a crumpled paper ball are dropped at the same time,
    the paper ball reaches the ground first. This happens because the paper ball
    has better aerodynamics and experiences less air resistance.
</p>

<h3>Uses of Aerodynamics in Real Life</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Helps vehicles move faster</li>
    <li>Reduces air resistance and drag</li>
    <li>Saves fuel and energy</li>
    <li>Improves performance and safety</li>
    <li>Used in aeroplanes, cars and sports equipment</li>
</ul>


    <h2>Real Life Applications of Science</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Force helps us push, pull and lift objects</li>
        <li>Friction allows vehicles to stop using brakes</li>
        <li>Speed helps compare fast and slow vehicles</li>
        <li>Air resistance is used in parachutes</li>
        <li>Gravity keeps us on the ground</li>
    </ul>



    <h2>What I Learned from STEM Racing</h2>
    <p>
        Through STEM activities, I learned that science is not only theory
        but also practical. I understood how small changes can affect results
        and how experiments help us learn better.
    </p>

    <h2>Why STEM Education is Important</h2>
    <p>
        STEM education improves logical thinking, creativity and problem-solving skills.
        It helps students understand how science and technology are used in daily life.
