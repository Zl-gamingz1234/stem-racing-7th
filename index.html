<!-- TEAM -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Our Team</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
This STEM Racing India project was completed as a collaborative and creative team
activity where each member played an essential role in bringing the idea to life.
Instead of working individually, we decided to combine our knowledge, skills,
and creativity to produce a stronger and more meaningful outcome. Every member
contributed effort in planning, researching, designing, testing, and presenting
the project. Through teamwork, we were able to share responsibilities and support
each other whenever challenges appeared.
</p>

<p>
Working as a group allowed us to explore different viewpoints and ideas. We learned
that cooperation, communication, and mutual respect are just as important as technical
knowledge. The process improved not only our understanding of science but also our
confidence, leadership skills, and time management abilities.
</p>

<h3>Team Members</h3>
<p><b>Team Leader – Aanik:</b> Responsible for coordination, decision-making, planning, and final presentation.</p>
<p><b>Research & Content – Aarav:</b> Collected scientific information, verified facts, and organized explanations.</p>
<p><b>Design & Creativity – Pratik:</b> Worked on visuals, structure, and creative improvements of the project.</p>

<h3>Role of Teamwork</h3>
<p>
Teamwork helped us divide tasks efficiently, reduce mistakes, and complete our work
within deadlines. It taught us patience, listening skills, and respect for different
opinions. We discovered that when ideas are shared and discussed, better solutions
can be created. This experience showed us that collaboration is a powerful tool
for learning and problem-solving.

<!-- STEM -->
<div class="section">
<h2>What is STEM?</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
STEM stands for <b>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</b>. It is an
educational approach that focuses on practical learning rather than only theory.
Instead of memorizing information, STEM encourages students to experiment, observe,
analyze results, and apply knowledge to real-life situations. This method of learning
develops curiosity, logical thinking, creativity, and innovation.
</p>

<p>
STEM education is important because it prepares students for future challenges in a
technology-driven world. It teaches problem-solving skills, critical thinking,
and the ability to connect different subjects together. By understanding STEM,
students become more confident in exploring new ideas and developing solutions.
</p>
</div>

<h2>What is STEM Racing India?</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
STEM Racing India is an educational initiative that introduces students to science and
engineering through engaging activities and experiments. It allows students to explore
how physics, design, and mathematics work together in practical scenarios. Instead of
only reading about concepts, participants observe and test them in action.
</p>

<p>
This program strengthens analytical thinking, teamwork, presentation skills, and
technical awareness. It turns learning into an interactive experience where curiosity
and creativity are encouraged. Students gain confidence and better understanding of
how science applies to the real world.

<!-- SCIENCE -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Science Concepts Explained</h2>

<div class="grid">

<div class="card">
<b>Force</b>
<p>
Force is a push or pull that can change the speed, direction, or shape of an object.
Without force, motion cannot start or stop. Everyday examples include pushing a door,
lifting a bag, or kicking a football.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<b>Motion</b>
<p>
Motion refers to the movement of an object from one position to another over time.
An object is considered in motion when its position changes compared to its surroundings.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<b>Speed</b>
<p>
Speed measures how fast an object travels. It is calculated using the formula
<b>Speed = Distance ÷ Time</b>. Speed helps us compare vehicles, runners, and
moving objects.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<b>Friction</b>
<p>
Friction is a force that resists motion when two surfaces touch each other.
Although friction can slow movement, it is also necessary because it prevents slipping
and helps vehicles stop safely.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<b>Gravity</b>
<p>
Gravity is the natural force that pulls objects toward the Earth’s center.
It keeps us grounded and causes objects to fall when dropped.
</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
<b>Aerodynamics</b>
<p>
Aerodynamics studies how air flows around moving objects. Smooth and curved shapes
reduce air resistance and allow objects to move faster and more efficiently.
</p>

<!-- LEARNING -->
<div class="section">
<h2>What We Learned</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
Through this project, we learned that science is not limited to textbooks.
Experiments and practical activities helped us understand how small design
changes can affect performance and results. We improved teamwork, creativity,
communication skills, and basic digital knowledge such as website creation.
</p>

<p>
The project also strengthened our confidence in presenting ideas and explaining
concepts clearly. It taught us patience, planning, and the importance of accuracy.
Overall, the experience was educational, enjoyable, and inspiring.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Why STEM Education is Important</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
STEM education builds strong foundations in logical reasoning, creativity,
and analytical thinking. It prepares students to adapt to modern technologies
and encourages innovation. By learning STEM, students gain the ability
to solve real-world problems and think independently.

<!-- SPONSORSHIP -->
<div class="section">
<h2>Sponsorship</h2>

<div class="card">
<b>Why Sponsor Us?</b>
<p>
Sponsoring our project directly contributes to better materials, testing quality,
and presentation improvements. Support allows us to refine ideas, perform
experiments more effectively, and develop stronger technical and creative skills.
