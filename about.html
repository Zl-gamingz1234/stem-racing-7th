  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>
  This website was created as a Class 7 STEM project to learn basic web design,
  HTML structure, and creative presentation. The goal was to combine science
  knowledge with technology skills.
  </p>

 <h2>Why We Chose This Logo</h2>
<p>
We chose this logo because it represents our team’s identity and legacy.
We have been using this logo for the past two years, which makes it
meaningful and familiar to our team. However, we also update and refine
the logo each year to show the cycle of change and improvement. This balance
between keeping the original idea and improving the design reflects how we
learn, grow, and develop new skills over time. The logo is simple,
recognizable, and represents both tradition and innovation.
</p>

  <h2>What I Learned</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Basic HTML and page structure</li>
    <li>Design and color combinations</li>
    <li>Uploading and hosting a website</li>
    <li>Organizing files and folders</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Future Improvements</h2>
  <p>
  In the future, I would like to add more interactive features,
  animations, and advanced styling.
